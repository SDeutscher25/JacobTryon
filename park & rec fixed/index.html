			<h2> Finn Mertens</h2>

        <h2>Who is Finn Mertens?</h2>
			<p>Prior to the start of Adventure Time, Finn was adopted as an infant by two anthropomorphic dogs named Joshua and Margaret, who found him in the woods. His best friend and adoptive brother Jake the Dog (John DiMaggio) accompany him on many of his adventures in Ooo, the fictional world that the series is set in. The mystery surrounding Finn's origins and whether he is the last human left in Ooo is a major part of the character's narrative arc. Later in the series, it is revealed that there are other humans still living in Ooo and that Finn's parents Martin Mertens and Minerva Campbell came from a community of survivors living on a chain of islands. </p>
		<p> Finn for the first time saw large amounts of humans. Finn met his mother, Minerva Campbell while on the island. His mother is no longer a human and is now a virtual consciousness (A.I.) due to sacrificing her body in order to treat the human race from a virus. Finn was offered to live on the island, but Finn decided to go home to Ooo rather than live with the rest of his species. So, after the miniseries Islands, Finn being "the last human" was completely dispelled. Though in the Islands CN Side, Adam Muto stated that Finn being the last human in the world was never the most important thing about him.</p>
			<p>Finn is also shown as willing to sacrifice himself in order to save others, as seen in the episode "James." With all other plans of escaping the Oozers showing no promise, Finn offered himself as a sacrifice without hesitation, so the others may escape. Though, He was knocked out and Princess Bubblegum convinced James to be the sacrifice instead.</p>

			<h3>Jake The Dog</h3>
			<img src="ta.png" alt=" Jake">
      <h3>Who is Jake The Dog?</h3>
			<p>Jake was conceived when his parents, Joshua and Margaret, were on an investigation tracking down a shape-shifting creature in the forest near Tree Trunks's house. During the investigation, they were attacked by the creature, and it bit Joshua on the head. Jake was later born from the pustule that formed from the bite on his father's head and was taken in by Joshua and Margaret to live alongside their natural-born son Jermaine. It is inferred that Jake's Stretchy Powers that he has had since he was a puppy are a result of his biological relationship with the shape-shifting creature, although Jake himself never learned this until the creature (revealing his name to be Warren Ampersand) returned in "Jake the Starchild." Before this point, Jake believed he had gained his powers from rolling in mud as a puppy.[3] Little is revealed of Jake's past with his family. At some point, when Jake and Jermaine were still infants, Joshua and Margaret found a human baby named Finn abandoned in the woods, raising him as their own. Jake would develop a lifelong friendship with Finn over the years. Joshua was known to push his three sons to be tough, while Margaret was often more protective and nurturing towards them. Jake regardless generally holds fond memories of being raised by them in their old house.</p>
			<p>Although he lacks the zeal for fighting that Finn possesses, Jake is a capable fighter. What he lacks in Finn's talent for swordsmanship, he makes up for in toughness and magical brawn. He is a capable hand-to-hand fighter and can transform his limbs into weapons. He can also stretch to entangle enemies or grow to gain a height and weight advantage. Jake’s powers are magical in nature. His shapeshifting can grant him supernatural strength, allowing him to simply overpower his enemies. However, Pendleton Ward has said in an interview that Jake uses his powers lazily and does not know their full extent, often hindering Jake's effectiveness in combat. Despite stating outright that he's multiple times stronger than Finn, Jake often leaves the brawling to his adoptive brother.</p>

        <h4>Who is BMO?</h4>
			<p>BMO, on a mission to terraform Mars, is intercepted by "Olive", a service droid, who takes them across the universe to the Drift, a huge failing space station. BMO meets Y4, a rabbit-like scavenger girl, and Mr M, secretly Martin Mertens, Finn's father, during which they become a local legend and foil a plot to steal the Drifts power, masterminded by a biohacked human refugee named Hugo. BMO returns to Earth on a space lard, crash landing in Ooo and meeting a young Finn and Jake, who they would live with for years to come.

</p>
			<p>Moe is BMO's creator, as shown in the episode "Be More." He created BMO because he wanted BMO to take care of his son, but he "never ended up dating any women." Moe created BMO so they could "Be More." Unlike a number of artificially created characters in the series (such as Lemongrab or Goliad), BMO is shown to be on good terms with their creator. The two embraced shortly after Moe fixed BMO's operating system informedly than revealing his creation's family in an underground civilization of happy MOs.

			<h5>Simon Petrikov</h5>
			<img src="simon.jpg" alt="Ice King">
        <h5>Who is Simon Petrikov?</h5>
			<p>Simon used the Ice Crown to survive the Mushroom War, and was one of the very few survivors at the time. Shortly after the bombs, he found a young Marceline crying in the wreckage. He gave her a stuffed doll from a toy shop destroyed in the conflict to comfort her. This toy would eventually become Marceline's most precious possession, Hambo, which she would keep and cherish until it was sold to Maja the Sky Witch by her ex-boyfriend, Ash. Simon became a father figure to Marcy, and used the crown to protect Marceline from dangerous creatures left over from the mushroom war. However, Marceline urged Simon to not use the crown, as whenever he did he slowly turned more and more insane.</p>
			<p>As time passed, Simon began to lose his mind as he began to wear the crown, deteriorating in both mind and body over the years into his current state. His condition worsened after his fiancée Betty was spirited into his future, which played a role in his subconscious need for princesses. As his mind and body became further twisted by the crown, Simon thought himself "too far gone" to find an escape from its influence, though he hoped that he could one day regain his sanity enough so that Betty, his "princess," would come back and love him again. Before losing his mind completely, Simon wrote a letter to Marceline using some of his old newspapers asking her to forgive him for what he would do to her after losing himself. He eventually lost his humanity; the power of the crown not only twisted his mind but his body as well. His species/race was Wizard according to the writers.</p>
