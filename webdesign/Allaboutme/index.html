        <h2>What i am intrested in</h2>
        <p>
            I am intrested in coding because for the longest time i have played videogames but i always wanted to know
            how they work. So I started taking classes that would help expand my knowledge on how projects like
            videogames are made.

        <h4>&#126;Future Goals&#126;</h4>
        <p>
            My future goal is to use coding as a job. any type of coding has been fun to lean and it would probably pay
            well. I would need a collage degree to work with coding for a company so i am looking for a good collage for
            coding.
